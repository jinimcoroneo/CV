I am a driven and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge.

With over 6 years of experience in Business Development, Marketing, Communications and Events Management across the United States, Middle East and Southeast Asia, I have a strong visual sense, excellent written and oral communication skills, and the ability to translate marketing ideas and design concepts across all platforms.

After my latest job as the client servicing director for an independent creative advertising agency in Singapore, I began studying coding and web development on my own through various online resources and when I moved to London, I learned to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, Node.js, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Collaborator

During my time at Accomplice and Makers Academy, I worked on numerous group projects which required working closely with a team of peers. I enjoy listening to new ideas and approaches to solving problems and I am able to contribute my own ideas to the discussion. In addition, I believe being a good collaborator is a very important skill which can always be improved upon and I try to continue developing my written and verbal communication skills in all aspects of my life, at work, through personal interactions, and through my volunteering efforts.

#### Thrives under pressure

From organising large scale events for the Chamber of Commerce in Dubai to developing campaign ideas and presentations with a very quick turn around time, I have always thrived when working under pressure and under deadline. It is my strong time management and organisational skills that I have developed throughout my professional career, in addition to my time at Makers Academy, that allows me to do this.

#### Fast learner

I earned a full-time offer at Accomplice Ad Agency by impressing my Managing Director with how quickly I was able to pick up new concepts, such programmatic ad buying and using an unknown platform for analysing social media insights. In addition, I was able to learn numerous high level programming concepts at Makers Academy in a relatively short amount of time. For my [News App project](<github URL>), I learned about new JavaScript concepts and how to use a new API to create a Guardian news aggregator over a weekend.
